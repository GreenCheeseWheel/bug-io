# Bug tracker basics
This bug tracker is made to be for personal projects and relatively small projects in collaboration with others. It is made open-source for personalization purposes.

## How do I start using it?
What you first want to do is clone this repo!
After you've cloned it inside a folder of your liking you should create a .env.local file
that has the next variables:

***NEXTAUTH_URL**: This variables stores the base url where the project will be hosted (i.e. http://localhost:3000)

***NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: This acts as a password. You should use it! Else the prod. build will throw an exception

***NEXT_PUBLIC_MONGODB_URI**: This is the uri of you mongodb database. If you want to know how to set it up correctly visit https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/nextjs-with-mongodb/
